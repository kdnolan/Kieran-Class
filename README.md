Made popular by Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak with their No Agenda Show podcast that has been running since 2007, the Value 4 Value model has been around for centuries. Its most popular age-old example is busking. 

V4V is a business model that aims to create a fair exchange of value between content creators and consumers by allowing users to directly support creators they appreciate with monetary contributions.

In the context of education, the V4V concept could be applied in several ways. For example, students could be given the option to directly support their teachers with financial contributions, as a way of expressing their appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the teachers.

This could be done through a platform that enables students to make donations to their teachers, with the contributions going towards supporting their efforts in teaching and educating. In this way, teachers could be incentivized to provide high-quality education, as they would be rewarded for their efforts.

Similarly, educators and researchers could create educational content that is available to the public for free, and those who appreciate the content could choose to make voluntary donations to support the creators. This could help to create a more sustainable model for producing high-quality educational materials, while also encouraging content creators to continue producing valuable content.

Overall, the V4V model provides an alternative to traditional payment models, which often involve intermediaries and complex distribution systems. By allowing for direct support and exchange of value between creators and consumers, V4V could help to create a more equitable and sustainable education system.

I want this repository to act as an exploration/experiment of how to enable V4V for education.
